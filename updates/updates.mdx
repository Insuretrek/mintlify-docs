  ## Lists and Quick Filters

  ## Other Fixes

  - We updated our logic so job titles are limited to 25 characters, which matches what NIPR is expecting to get.
  - List Builder now includes more information, including:
    - Who a producer reports to
    - Business Address
    - some general bug fixes
